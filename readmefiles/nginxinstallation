Implementation of HTTP/3 and QUIC is integrated to installation of Nginx. This NGINX project by Cloudflare made available to the wider community to help pushadoption of QUIC and HTTP/3 . Nginx has their official release of this Web server with QUIC support which is a mercurialfeature release in which the code is at an alpha level of quality.Before installing NGINX with HTTP/3 support we need to install a BoringSSLlibrary that provides QUIC support .

The procedure to build BoringSSL is as follows:

$ git clone https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl$ cd boringssl/

$ mkdir build$ cd build/

$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd

After successfully installing BoringSSL the steps to install NGINX with HTTP/3are as follows:

$ hg clone -b quic https://hg.nginx.org/nginx-quiccd nginx-quic
sudo $ ./auto/configure –prefix=/etc/nginx–sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx–modules-path=/usr/lib/nginx/modules–conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf–error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log–pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid–lock-path=/var/run/nginx.lock –with-debug–with-http_v3_module –with-cc-opt="-I../boringssl/include"–with-ld-opt="-L../boringssl/build/ssl -L../boringssl/build/crypto" –with-http_ssl_module–with-http_v2_module –with-http_v3_module–with-http_quic_module –with-stream_quic_module

$ make

To check the nginx version$ nginx -Vnginx version:
